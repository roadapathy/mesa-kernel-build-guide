# Mesa-Kernel Build Guide
Step-by-step guide to building CPU and GPU optimized Mesa and Linux Kernel. Currently, its focus is on the Ubuntu series of distros. For Debian based distros, this guide should be useful. For Arch users, not so much; however, it will provide hints on how to optimize other distros.

------

## 1. Latest Toolchain

https://github.com/roadapathy/mesa-kernel-build-guide/blob/main/Step1-Toolchain.md

- Always build with the **latest stable compiler toolchain** available (e.g., GCC 15 instead of GCC 14).
- Newer compilers provide improved **code generation**, enhanced optimization techniques, better CPU/GPU support, and critical bug fixes.
- This ensures all subsequent optimizations build on the best possible foundation.

------

## 2. System Impact: Key Projects Affecting the Linux OS Experience

Focus on projects critical to system performance and user experience, such as:

- **Linux Kernel** (core of OS functionality)
- **Mesa** (GPU drivers and graphics stack)
- **Firefox** (widely used browser, performance-critical app)
- **OpenJDK** (Java runtime, used by many apps)

These projects have broad system impact, so optimizing them benefits many workflows and applications.

------

## 3. Core Dependencies: Libraries That Enable or Support Key Projects

Include important libraries and components that these projects rely on, such as:

- Compression libraries: `zlib`, `liblz4`, `zstd`
- Graphics and rendering libraries: `glslanglib`, `libpng`, `libjpeg-turbo`, `freetype2`
- System-level X libraries: `libX11`, `libxcb`
- Multimedia and audio libraries: `FAudio`, `SDL2`
- Parsing and utility libraries: `ICU`, `PCRE2`

Optimizing these ensures upstream performance benefits cascade into the key projects.

------

## 4. CPU and GPU Architecture Optimizations

Use CPU-specific flags generalized to broader compatibility, such as:

- `-march=native` to target the build system’s CPU features dynamically
- Vector width hints like `-mprefer-vector-width=512` for wide SIMD on capable CPUs
- Tune for the microarchitecture (e.g., `-mtune=native`)

Use GPU driver and shading compiler flags where applicable (e.g., Mesa, SPIR-V libs) to leverage hardware features.

These optimizations maximize runtime performance on your specific hardware without sacrificing portability.

------

## 5. Generalized Function Types and Workload Characteristics

Tailor optimization flags to the dominant workload type of each project:

- **Compute-heavy projects** get vectorization and fast math flags.
- **Loop-heavy code** benefits from loop unrolling and cache optimizations.
- **Branch-heavy code** gets profile-guided optimizations for better prediction.
- **Memory-bound projects** focus on prefetching and memory access patterns.
- **Concurrent projects** enable threading and SIMD parallelism support.
- **Size or startup-sensitive projects** prioritize code size optimizations.

This functional approach ensures the best optimization strategies fit each project’s needs.
